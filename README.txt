== Description ==

= Give real information for real persuasion =
The YITH Woocommerce Request A Quote plugin lets your customers ask for an estimate of a list of products they are interested in.

With just a single button in the product detail page, users can create their own list to receive a quote from the administrators.

Quotations are one of the best ways to deal with certain types of purchases and it is very difficult to be played for online purchases.

One of the biggest limits of online business, in fact, is the impossibility to negotiate, to do that compromise that should be found between buyer and supplier. And it is comprehensible that, say, for a big amount of products, supplier and buyer might meet and find a more reasonable solution, that is good for both of them.
And all this becomes possible also for online shops. YITH Woocommerce Request A Quote allows contact between suppliers and customers and sharing of the list of items for which the quote is requested.
Negotiation becomes possible and this can definitely increase purchases in your shop. 

Plugin's features include:

* “Add to quote” button/text in the product detail page,
* An option to deactivate the “add to cart” button/text in the product detail page,
* Quote list page with a basic form (name, mail address, textarea)

Please, read the the **[official plugin documentation](http://yithemes.com/docs-plugins/yith-woocommerce-request-a-quote/)** to know all plugin features.
